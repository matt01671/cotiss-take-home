# Cotiss Takehome Project
## Overview

The United Nations Standard Products and Services Code is a global standard
for classifying companies and types of contracts. This code classification is fundamental to 
classifying procurement contracts and provides the basis for distinguishing similar types of tenders.
Please read more about the hierarchical convention here: https://www.unspsc.org/.

## Task

This project is open ended and designed to provide a platform to show your creativity and coding skills. 
We have provided a primive search experience where users can select categories that they may be interested in.
There is also no strict requirement on how the search bar should function, but _your job is to improve it!_ 
There are no right or wrong answers so don't overthink it - just state your assumptions and 
justification for the improvements you think are best. If you have any questions, please reach out to 
careers@cotiss.com and ask away - we're here to help!

We respect your time, so we only expect you to spend a few hours on the exercice.

### Assessment

Your project will be assessed on three key criteria:
1. User experience
2. Code quality
3. User interface

__Good luck!__

### Submission
